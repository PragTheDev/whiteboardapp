# Collaborative Whiteboard

A real-time collaborative whiteboard application built with Next.js and Socket.io. Draw, share, and create together in private rooms with instant synchronization across all connected users.
IMPORTANT: Currently the app doesn't work with real time collaboration in deployment. Currently, it only supports real time collaboration in your local development server.
